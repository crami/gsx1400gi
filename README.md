# Suzuki GSX1400 Gear Indicator

(And probably also works on other bikes)

Written for a Mini Arduino Pro 5v, 16Mhz version.

The Program reads out the analog value from the gear sensor and displays the gear on 6 LED.

TODO:

  - Make brightnes ajustable (sort of allready works, need button input and eeprom storage)
  - Realy test it on a real bike (till now only a breadboard setup)
