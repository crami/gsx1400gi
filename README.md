(And probably also works on other bikes)

Written for a Mini Arduino Pro 5v, 16Mhz version.

The Program reads out the analog value from the gear
sensor and displays the gear on 6 LED placed behind
the number 1 to 6 on the RPM dial.

When side stand is down or kill switch is enabled the
LEDs sweep up and down. Brightens can be controlled
by pressing the right button shortly.
